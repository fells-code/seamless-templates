"seamless-templates": patch
---

Run conformance from the repo root. Add a root conformance workflow that tests the templates against the ecosystem on PRs via the seamless-cli reusable workflow, and remove the inert per-template GitHub workflow that was carried over from the standalone starter (it did nothing here and leaked into scaffolded projects).
